      <h4> The Crispiest Buffalo Chicken Wings </h4>
      <p>Baked buffalo chicken wings are marvelous.
        You can get the crispy texture without the
        need to use lots of fryer oil. All using
        baking powder and a handy wire rack, they
        get the perfect crust with a fraction of 
        the fat of deep-fried wings. Tossing with
        buttery, tangy buffalo sauce makes the 
        wings irreristibly good.</p>
